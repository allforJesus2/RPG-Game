# Echoes of Elyria - Game Design Document

## Clan System: "The Echo Chamber"

### Core Concept
Players manage a small group (3-5 members) of Echo Keepers, each specializing in different aspects of physical and magical prowess. Like Pokemon's party system, each member has unique strengths and weaknesses.

### Clan Members
1. **The Echo Keeper (Player Character)**
   - Customizable protagonist
   - Balanced starter stats
   - Can learn any discipline
   
2. **Specialization Roles**
   Choose 2-4 from:
   - Strength Master (heavy lifting, power moves)
   - Endurance Scout (exploration, sustained activities)
   - Recovery Sage (healing, restoration magic)
   - Nutrition Alchemist (potion crafting, food preparation)
   - Movement Artist (agility, dodge specialist)

### Clan Development
- Each member has their own fitness/health stats
- Shared resources and knowledge
- Group training sessions provide bonuses
- Members can cover others' weaknesses

## Battle System: "Combat Training"

### Core Mechanics
1. **Real-time with Pause**
   - Combat flows naturally but can be paused for strategy
   - Action queue system similar to Final Fantasy XII
   - Time affects stamina and energy consumption

2. **Training Through Combat**
   - Each battle counts as a training session
   - Different enemy types target different fitness aspects:
     * Beast-type: Strength training (resistance)
     * Scout-type: Endurance training (cardio)
     * Mage-type: Recovery training (flexibility)
     * Tank-type: Full body workout (compound)
   
   - Combat Actions = Exercise Reps:
     * Basic attacks count as light sets
     * Special moves count as heavy sets
     * Dodging counts as cardio
     * Blocking counts as isometric exercise
   
   - Battle Duration Tracking:
     * 5-10 minutes = HIIT session
     * 10-20 minutes = Full workout
     * 20+ minutes = Risk of overtraining

3. **Combat Gains**
   - Victory rewards include:
     * Direct stat improvements
     * Exercise experience
     * New movement patterns/techniques
     * Recovery items

4. **Battle Fatigue**
   - Each combat burns calories
   - Depletes specific muscle groups
   - Affects recovery needs
   - Counts toward daily training limits

### Advanced Battle Training

1. **Elite Enemies**
   - Mini-boss battles = Progressive overload
   - Each has unique training benefits:
     * Stone Golem: Heavy resistance training
     * Wind Sprite: High-intensity cardio
     * Ancient Monk: Complex movement patterns
     * Shadow Warrior: Agility and reflexes

2. **Group Training Battles**
   - Multi-enemy encounters work multiple aspects:
     * Mixed enemy types = Circuit training
     * Wave battles = Endurance training
     * Boss + minions = Supersets
   
3. **Environmental Training**
   - Battle locations affect exercise intensity:
     * Mountain zones: Altitude training
     * Swamp areas: Balance training
     * Desert regions: Heat endurance
     * Ice fields: Cold adaptation

4. **Recovery Mechanics**
   - Post-battle recovery needs based on:
     * Battle intensity
     * Damage taken
     * Techniques used
     * Duration of fight
   
### Battle Progression
1. **Pre-Battle Preparation**
   - Meal planning for stat buffs

## The Devouring Time System

### Core Mechanics
1. **Daily Time Limit**
   - Each region has a "Devouring Meter" that fills over time
   - Training/activities accelerate the Devouring in that area
   - Once an area is fully Devoured, it becomes inaccessible for 24 real-time hours
   - Players must strategically choose which areas to use each day

2. **Devouring Effects**
   - Early Stage: Minor stat penalties (-10% to gains)
   - Mid Stage: Increased energy costs (+25%)
   - Late Stage: Damage over time and reduced recovery
   - Full Devour: Area becomes unusable until reset

3. **Management Strategies**
   - Different activities have different Devouring costs
     * Light training: Low impact
     * Intense training: High impact
     * Recovery activities: Minimal impact
     * Story missions: Fixed impact
   - Multiple areas available but can't use all daily
   - Strategic rest days to let areas recover

### Anti-Grinding Mechanics
1. **Diminishing Returns**
   - Repeated same-day activities accelerate Devouring
   - Forced variety in training locations
   - Encourages efficient, focused sessions
   - Rewards quality over quantity
