- More complex environment (Mountains)
- Basic cooking at campfire
- Monster parts as resources
- Slightly longer distance

### Level 3: Recovery
- Introduces recovery mechanics
- More challenging combat
- Basic injury system
- Sleep quality effects
- First Echo Crystal uses

## Mid Game (Adding Companions)

### First Companion (Level 4-5)

- Introduces team mechanics
- Basic skill synergies
- Shared resource management
- Dual character training

### Second Companion (Level 6-7)
- More complex team tactics
- Specialized roles emerge
- Group training benefits
- Resource distribution
- Three-person formations

## Level Design Philosophy

### Complexity Scaling
- Each level adds 1-2 new mechanics
- Previous mechanics remain relevant
- Natural difficulty increase
- Optional advanced techniques
- Hidden depth

### Environment Progress
1. Early Environments
   - Forest (foraging)
   - Mountains (climbing)
   - Beach (stamina)

2. Mid Environments
   - Jungle (navigation)
   - Ruins (ancient tech)
   - Caves (resources)

3. Late Environments
   - Arctic (survival)
   - Tropical Island (mastery)

### Resource Availability
- Early: Abundant basic resources
- Mid: More specific needs
- Late: Strategic resource management
