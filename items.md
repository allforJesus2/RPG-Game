I've created an items.md file that lists various items and equipment for your RPG game. The document includes:

1. Consumables like food and water
2. Equipment categories including weapons (melee/ranged) and armor
3. Miscellaneous items such as tools and potions
4. A section on equipment stats

The file is now available in the project directory and can be expanded with more specific details about each item type as your game development progresses.
