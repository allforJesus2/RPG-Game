# Food and Resource System

## Food Acquisition

### Foraging System
1. **Natural Sources**
   - Fruit trees/bushes (respawn daily)
   - Wild vegetables
   - Mushrooms (caves/forests)
   - Herbs and spices
   - Seeds and nuts

2. **Hunting/Fishing**
   - Small game (rabbits, birds)
   - Fish in water bodies
   - Monster parts (from defeated enemies)
   - Eggs from nests
   - Honey from hives

3. **Ancient Gardens**
   - Preserved farming plots in ruins
   - Self-maintaining magical crops
   - Rare nutrient-dense foods
   - Echo-infused plants

### Resource Management

1. **Preservation Methods**
   - Drying (jerky, dried fruits)
   - Smoking (meats)
   - Magical preservation (special items)
   - Salt curing (found in ruins)

2. **Storage System**
   - Limited inventory space
   - Food freshness timer
   - Preservation extends lifetime
   - Weight affects movement speed

## Alternative Currency System

### Echo Crystals
1. **Sources**
   - Dropped by monsters
   - Found in ruins
   - Reward for clearing areas
   - Hidden in environment
   - Formed from Devouring residue

2. **Uses**
   - Power training equipment
   - Enhance food properties
   - Unlock ancient preservation tech
   - Repair found equipment
   - Create recovery items

### Ancient Technology

1. **Food Replicators**
   - Found in ruins/spaceships
   - Requires Echo Crystals
   - Creates basic nutrient supplies
   - Limited daily uses
   - Quality based on crystal quality

2. **Preservation Chambers**
   - Extends food lifetime
   - Maintains nutrient value
   - Uses Echo Crystal power
   - Found in ancient structures
   - Can be transported to base

## Crafting System

### Food Preparation

1. **Cooking Methods**
   - Campfire (basic)
   - Ancient stoves (advanced)
   - Magical infusion (special)
   - Cold preparation
   - Dehydration

2. **Recipe Discovery**
   - Found in ruins
   - Experiment combinations
   - Learn from monster drops
   - Ancient data logs
   - Trial and error

3. **Meal Benefits**
   - Stat boosts
   - Recovery enhancement
   - Training optimization
   - Energy restoration
   - Special abilities

### Resource Crafting

1. **Training Equipment**
   - From monster parts
   - Ancient tech repair
   - Temporary enhancements
   - Portable equipment
   - Recovery tools

2. **Supplements**
   - Herb combinations
   - Monster part extracts
   - Ancient formulas
   - Crystal infusions
   - Emergency rations

## Integration with Time System

### Resource Planning

1. **Food Gathering**
   - Takes movement time
   - Must balance with objectives
   - Different times for methods
   - Risk vs reward choices
   - Weather effects

2. **Preparation Time**
   - Cooking freezes time
   - Quick vs proper meals
   - Batch cooking benefits
   - Preservation time investment
   - Recipe experimentation

### Environment Effects

1. **Biome-Specific Resources**
   - Jungle: Abundant fruits
   - Tundra: Preserved meats
   - Beach: Seafood
   - Forest: Game and berries
   - Cave: Mushrooms
   - Mountain: Herbs
   - Savanna: Hardy vegetables
   - Island: Diverse mix

2. **Weather Impact**
   - Rain fills water sources
   - Heat speeds spoilage
   - Cold preserves food
   - Wind affects foraging
   - Storms limit gathering

## Strategic Elements

### Resource Planning

1. **Daily Requirements**
   - Base nutrition needs
   - Training supplements
   - Emergency supplies
   - Recovery items
   - Water management

2. **Risk Management**
   - Food spoilage
   - Energy for gathering
   - Time investment
   - Crystal usage
   - Inventory space

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Efficient Gathering**
   - Route planning
   - Resource density
   - Time of day
   - Weather consideration
   - Energy efficiency

2. **Meal Planning**
   - Nutrient timing
